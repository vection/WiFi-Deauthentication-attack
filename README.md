## Deauthentication attack tool
The main goal here is to make a simple tool that allows you to make deauthentication attack easly.
The script requires network card that support monitor mode, you don't need any knowledge to make it work.
In addition, the script automatically change the card to monitor mode.
All you need to do is run the script.


# Instructions
- Open terminal and run the tool
- Insert network card interface name
- The tool will scan your area
- Choose one from the list of APs
- Now it will preform another scan to locate clients who connected to selected AP
- Choose one of the clients
- Attack will start and client should go disconnected

# Some improvments
- You can change the number of packets that being sent to client
- You also can make it a little more consistent to preform a better long-term affect
